        <h2>Personal Favourites</h2>
    
    <p>My personal favourite song recorded and performed by P!nk is <em>Just Like a Pill</em>. The lyrics and rythem of the song is both compelling and moving for me. My favourite cover done for this song is by <it>Tegan and Sara</it> performed at the Billboard music event for Women which can be found below. Pink is an inspiration of mine who constantly creates amazing albums and singles that reach the top of music charts around the world</p>
